        <h1>The 10 Steps</h1>
        <p>Here you are at last, I must say I'm disappointed in your progress, 
            I'd imagine you'd be here sooner. Well you're here now and that's what's important.
        </p>
        <p>This is it, the 10 steps to your Desensitization towards Violence.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A1.png" alt="Conan">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/barbarian.png" alt="Conan Logo">
        <br>
        <p>Arr yes the origins of Violence. As with a lot of stories it starts at childhood. 
            Conan experienced as much when Thulsa Doom and his boys rolled into town, 
            beheading his mommy and having doggies eat his daddy. But let's not bicker and argue about who killed who, 
            It's time to push a giant wheel Conan to get big and strong, 
            then maybe just maybe Crom will grant you REVENGE. Lots of hacking and slashing in this one.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A2.png" alt="Terminator">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/ter1.png" alt="Terminator Logo">
        <br>
        <p>Now here we are talking. Step aside Ridley Scott’s Xenomorph, this is the ultimate organism. 
            Terminator is more than a cyborg, it's the perfect killing machine. It can't be bargained with, 
            it can't be reasoned with, it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear, and it absolutely will not stop, 
            ever until you are dead. Possibly the best example of having no empathy is the T-800 Model 101 Infiltrator Unit. 
            Sarah got lucky beating him. Just saying.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 3</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A3.jpg" alt="Commando">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/co.png" alt="Commando Logo">
        <br>
        <p>Wow where even to begin with this example. Far and above this one has the highest kill count of all, 
            leaving many grieving families destitute. But this one man’s actions are completely justifiable. 
            John Matrix was minding his own business feeding deer, lifting trees and eating ice cream. 
            Then a South American dictator kidnaps his daughter Jenny and says he has to do what they tell him to do in order to see her again. 
            WRONG, Matrix’s mission now is to use any weapon be that machine guns, chair legs, gravity and even garden equipment to save Jenny. 
            This guy is one mean mother who eats green berets for breakfast. Don't be fooled he lies he won't kill you last.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 4</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A4.png" alt="Predator">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/pred.png" alt="Predator Logo">
        <br>
        <p>What's more unsympathetic than one man who wants nothing more than to kill his enemies? A whole team of men with that same mindset. 
            Dutch must lead his team into the middle of a South American jungle on a rescue mission. 
            Battling with the guerrilla’s and the heat of the jungle they become prey to an invisible force that ain't no man. 
            Well not on Dutch’s watch, it's time the hunter becomes the hunted. Dutch will stop at nothing to crush his enemy. 
            He will use reflexes to fire guns, use muscles to build manly traps, 
            get all muddy to fight on the enemies terms and assist in shooting up the jungle itself. If it bleeds he can kill it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 5</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A5.png" alt="Running Man">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/run.png" alt="Running Man Logo">
        <br>
        <p>Now this is the original Hunger Games. In the future of 2019 Ben Richards dubbed the Butcher of Bakerdfield is framed for war crimes he didn't commit. 
            After being picked up by Damon Killian he is forced onto the Running Man where he must run to earn a pardon. 
            But when the stakers try to kill Richards he kills right back at them. Razor hockey blades, 
            chainsaws and flamethrowers can't stop him. When he reaches his pursuer’s he will ram his fist into their stomach’s and break their goddamn spine’s. 
            If he catches up with that cutiepie Killian one of them will be in deep trouble.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 6</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A6.png" alt="Total Recall">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/recall.png" alt="Total Recall Logo">
        <br>
        <p>Douglas Quaid is your simple everyday man till one day he goes to those dream butchers at Rekall. 
            The procedure goes wrong when Quaid is not Quaid anymore but Carl Hauser who holds the secrets to Mars. 
            Whether he is actually Hauser or just Quaid in a violent fugue state makes no difference. 
            This simple everyday man goes on a violent killing spree in order to survive and seek the truth. 
            This showcases a man devolving, being able to mock his victims. Truly some of Paul Verhoeven’s best work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 7</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A7.jpg" alt="Terminator 2">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/t2.png" alt="Terminator 2 Logo">
        <br>
        <p>The awe inspiring T-800 Model 101 returns but this time he swears he will not kill anyone? 
            Yes unforntally that damn John Conner can make demands to prevent the Terminator from actually terminating people. 
            So in this one the T-1000 unit does most of the killing. 
            But that doesn't prevent uncle Bob from physically assaulting people by throwing them onto burger grills and shooting off kneecaps. 
            This is one hell of a ride. Hasta la vista baby.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 8</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A8.png" alt="Last Action Hero">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/last.png" alt="Last Action Hero Logo">
        <br>
        <p>Jack Slater is the coolest LAPD cop living in his Jack Slater universe. 
            That is until one day that darn brat Danny Madigan had to drop in with his magic movie ticket 
            (movie ticket - used to be a proof of entry into a cinema)(cinema - used to be a place where multiple people went to watch a movie). 
            Slater has to deal with this kid but that doesn't deter him from exacting revenge on those who killed his favorite second cousin Frank. 
            In all honesty Charles Dance steals the show and the greatest crime to humanity is we didn't get to see that Arnold Schwarzenegger Hamlet.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 9</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A9.png" alt="True Lies">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/lies.png" alt="True Lies Logo">
        <br>
        <p>You're nearing the end of our journey. This next subject is Harry Tasker of Omega Sector. 
            Harry lives the perfect life pretending to be a sales rep whilst being a secret agent. 
            You know what this means, Harry has permission to kill anyone who doesnt recognize America’s world dominance. 
            He archives this by using any weapon on hand or any vehicle be that police horse or Harrier Jump Jet. 
            The most terrifying aspect to Harry is his unwavering ability of psychologically terrorizing his wife Helen. 
            Harry has the best excuse to justify the mass graves he leaves behind him. “They were all bad guys”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 10</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/A10.png" alt="Jingle all the Way">
        <br>
        <img src="pictures/jingle.png" alt="Jingle all the Way Logo">
        <br>
        <p>This is it isnt it, the end that is. Jingle All The Way the ultimate evil, the final sin. 
            The end of all human feelings. Once you have experienced this movie you will never be able to be the same again. 
            These steps are a means to become explorers in the further regions of experience. 
            You will become Demons to some Angels to others. And no tears please as it is a waste of good suffering. 
            What I am trying to say is Jingle All The Way is the most evil creation of mankind and it will break you. 
            Congratulations if you made it to the end.
        </p>
