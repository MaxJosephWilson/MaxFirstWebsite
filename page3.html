        <h1>The Beasts</h1>
        <p>Here are the beasts. Burmillaâ€™s the most annoying, most needy cats of all time. 
            A result of a horrifying breeding mess up back in 81 the Burmilla is here to wreck you day. 
            Notice the disgusting head pattern, the lifeless eyes, 
            these guys are thick and will get on with anyone who has food. 
            They regrettably keep their kitten playfulness well into adulthood. 
            This makes them feisty and in need of loving.
        </p>

        <p>The one above is Evie. she was the quiet one be now she just won't shut up. 
            Always trying to get into your room and just wants to be loved. 
            Also she has a passion for chewing all of your small cables. 
            Careful where you place your earphones.

        <img src="pictures/theo.jpg" alt="Theo">
        <br>
        <p>Now this one is Theo. He is evil incarnate. 
            Even with his disposition of not having opposable thumbs he has learnt to open doors. 
            He's one real s.o.b destroying furniture, playfully lacerating skin. 
            Messing around with this one is dangerous.
