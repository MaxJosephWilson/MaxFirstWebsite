        <h1>Hello and Welcome to me.</h1>
        <br>
        <p>So my name is Max Joseph Wilson and here's a summary of me. 
            So being brief with my childhood I was an awkward child, no real friends, quite, 
            hit with early traumas that shape people into who they are. 
            I never wanted to be seen unlike people who are constantly trying to stand out. 
            Anyways I forced myself through school and higher education to end up battling my 
            social anxiety through bartending and then selling whisky in retail. 
            Then I ended up here trying to find something to do with my pathetic life. 
            Apparently everyone has something to offer this world. 
            I'm still trying to figure out what that something is.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>There you have it. Not as happy as people would want but i can't be something i'm not. Look around to see more of the disaster that is me.</p>
